#Final Project

__Your final project will be to create a self-contained visual story of your own making. It must visualize multiple aspects of that story and be organized in such a way as to be a story, with a lead, a nutgraph and a body. It should include original reporting and can include multimedia.__

__This story will be contained in a single HTML page of your own design. Your elements will be arranged by you.__

__You will be graded on the quality of the story, the creativity and clarity of the visualizations and the visual presentation of the story.__
