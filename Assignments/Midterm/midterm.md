#Midterm: Putting it all together#

* Using a story in the news, find some data that visualizes a key point of the story or news event (i.e. our assignment to visualize costs by state in Obamacare exchanges).
* Clean, analyze and otherwise distill that data into something you can visualize.
* Make one or more visualizations of your data in one of the tools we've used so far (Excel, ChartBuilder, FusionTables)
* In the Markdown file in the folder with your name on it, write explanatory chatter about your visualization in news style. I intend to publish these on a [Developing New Media blog](http://jour491.tumblr.com).
* Include in your visualization your byline and the source of your data.
* Commit your markdown file and your visualization -- image files for Chartbuilder and Excel, a link to Fusion Tables -- to GitHub by noon Thursday Oct. 24. 


Notes:

* If I were you, I would not rely on the federal government for data. Most of those sites are closed down. State and local governments have data and news too.
