###Let's take an example and hack it.

[Here's the example](http://bl.ocks.org/natemiller/20f9bd99d1795e3a0b1c)

###Workflow

1. Let's look at the code first. What does it require? 
2. Now let's clean up our data and get it into a form that our example requires.
3. Copy out the example code into a new html file.
4. Match up your data file name to the new file name.
5. Look. Did it work? 
6. What needs to change?
