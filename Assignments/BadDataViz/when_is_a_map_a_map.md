#When is a map a map?#

1. [Look at this](http://greendale.patch.com/groups/newscruncher/p/map-where-do-the-divorced-women-live-in-town-greendale).
2. [Look](http://jimromenesko.com/2013/10/09/patch-memo-tells-editors-how-to-deal-with-where-divorced-people-live-posts/) at the [criticism](http://www.onthemedia.org/story/map-all-divorces/).
3. Read [this](http://www.ericson.net/content/2011/10/when-maps-shouldnt-be-maps/).
4. Write me a short paper -- 500 to 1000 words -- detailing three criticisms why this is bad data visualization, using the above links and your Tufte and Cairo texts. Detail your criticisms.
5. Due by next class.
